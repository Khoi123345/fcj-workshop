### Key Highlights

#### 1. Designing a Scalable URL Shortener on AWS (Kien & Tho)
- **Problem Statement:** A standard URL shortener translates long URLs into short codes. A simple model (User → Frontend → Backend → Database) is cheap and easy to build but suffers from high read latency, single points of failure (SPOF), and is highly difficult to scale when traffic surges.
- **Cloud Architecture Blueprint:**
  - **Edge Security & Routing:** Managed via **Amazon Route 53** (DNS), **Amazon CloudFront** (CDN) for caching, and **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) to filter malicious traffic. Security is reinforced using **AWS Secrets Manager**, **AWS KMS**, **AWS IAM**, and **AWS Certificate Manager**.
  - **Frontend:** Deployed and managed seamlessly through **AWS Amplify**.
  - **Backend Compute:** Deployed as SpringBoot containers on **AWS Fargate** (Amazon ECS) behind an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, distributed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
  - **Database & Cache:** Built on **Amazon DynamoDB** (NoSQL primary store) and **Amazon ElastiCache for Redis** (located in a private database subnet) to accelerate read/write latency.
- **Inside the Architecture:**
  - **Key Generation Service (KGS):** To prevent key collisions and runtime overhead, a dedicated service running on ECS containers pre-computes unique short codes (e.g., `GpFHUcn`, `aB3xZ9q`) and pushes them to Redis using the `LPUSH key_queue` command.
  - **Create Flow:** When a user requests a short URL, the backend pops a pre-generated code from Redis using `RPOP` and writes the `{short_code: long_url}` pair directly to DynamoDB. This guarantees an instant, collision-free write process.
  - **Forward Flow:** Clicking a short link triggers a Redis lookup. If found (Cache Hit), the user is redirected immediately. If not (Cache Miss), the backend queries DynamoDB and caches the pair back into Redis for subsequent requests (Cache-aside pattern).

#### 2. Data Analytics & Corporate Culture in MNCs (Dat Pham & Cuong Nguyen)
- **Real-world Scope of Data Analytics:**
  - **Kamereo (B2B food supply platform):** Focuses on creating daily/weekly operational performance dashboards, monitoring business trends, detecting anomalies, and coordinating cross-departmentally to solve business problems.
  - **Colgate-Palmolive (FMCG MNC):** Focuses on collecting and analyzing machine data and IoT logs in manufacturing plants, identifying cost-saving opportunities, and supporting long-term digital transformation initiatives.
- **Four Core Skills:** Critical thinking, clear communication, data storytelling (turning dry numbers into actionable business recommendations, such as analyzing GMV fluctuations instead of just presenting reports), and data-driven problem solving.
- **Kamereo Live Case Study (Hanoi Operations):** Demonstrated a live operations dashboard measuring GMV growth (+0.5%), Average Order Value (AOV 913K), Daily orders (78 orders), Fulfillment Cost (FFM% 11.7%-13.2%), Last Mile Cost (LMC% 7.8%), and a 99.1% fill rate.
- **5-Stage Career Growth Mindset:**
  1. *Follower:* Executes detailed instructions and learns the ropes (Intern/Junior).
  2. *Learner:* Understands problem-solving but relies on mentor guidance; asks deep questions.
  3. *Problem Solver:* Moves away from checklist mentalities, conducts root-cause analysis, and takes ownership of output quality.
  4. *System Thinker:* Visualizes the big picture, analyzes cross-functional risk, evaluates financial impact, and optimizes workflows long-term.
  5. *Super Star:* Establishes data strategies, builds architectural visions, and mentors the next generation.
- **MNC Recruitment Process:** Consists of 4 competitive rounds: CV Screening & English HR Screening Call, Capability Test (logic/tech/supply chain tests), Professional Interview (diving deep into real cases using the **STAR** model), and Culture Fit Interview with leadership.
- **Decoded MNC Cultures:**
  - *No-Blame Post-Mortem:* Applied in tech giants; when systems fail, engineers investigate root causes to fix the system rather than penalizing individuals.
  - *Caring & Inclusive:* Applied in FMCG MNCs; prioritizes human development, diversity, and continuous improvement.

#### 3. National Context & Global Standards (Dat Pham & Cuong Nguyen)
- **Logistics & IT Evolution in Vietnam (1975 - 1997):**
  - *1975 - 1986:* Economic isolation and rationing. Logistics was manual and limited.
  - *1986 - 1995:* Doi Moi reforms and foreign diplomacy opened trade routes. Diplomacy acted as the nation's first "logistics" mechanism.
  - *1997:* Official global Internet connection on November 19, 1997, opening digital information flows.
- **FDI & Digital Factory Wave:** Driven by two domino effects: Physical (WTO/FTAs → FDI → Production → Logistics) and Digital (4G/Broadband → Smartphones → Startups → Cloud Adoption).
- **Compliance & Standards:** Moving from "getting things done" to "doing things to global standards":
  - *Physical Supply Chain:* Adhering to **GMP**, **GSP**, and **GDP** to ensure safety and quality.
  - *Digital Supply Chain (Tech/Cloud):* Complying with **ISO 27001**, **SOC 2**, and **GDPR** to secure digital assets and national data sovereignty.
  - *Philosophical Foundation:* Tri-pillar "Dong Viec" model: *Làm người* (kindness, empathy, self-governance), *Làm nghề* (solving problems with professional excellence), and *Làm dân* (responsibility to the nation, building lasting digital lifelines).

#### 4. Real-world DevOps Realities & Fundamentals (Hoang Trong)
- **Market Trends & Salaries:** Huge growth in data and infrastructure recruitment (AI/ML, Data, Cloud, Security, DevOps). DevOps/Cloud salaries range from Junior (16-28M VND), Mid (28-45M VND), Senior (45-65M VND) up to Lead/Expert (65-100M VND).
- **Scope of DevOps Work:** Context-dependent and client-oriented. A DevOps Engineer handles requests from all directions:
  - *Developers:* Debugging staging environments when local configurations work but staging fails.
  - *QA/Testers:* Recovering test environments and managing system permissions.
  - *Clients:* Incident handling, troubleshooting, and on-call rotations for production performance.
  - *Project Managers:* Release management and clarifying system ownership.
  - *Security Teams:* Scanning and patching package vulnerabilities.
  - *Finance Teams:* Investigating cloud billing spikes and optimizing infrastructure costs.
- **DevOps Core Fundamentals:** Focus on OS (Linux), networking concepts, scripting (Python, Go), Git & CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and understanding application operations.
- **Career Advice:** Do not copy-paste commands blindly; identify the real owner of the problem; ask "Why" before "How"; communication is key; and avoid trying to be a team-carrying hero. Maintain system-level thinking, automate boring tasks, and use AI (ChatGPT) without switching off your brain.

#### 5. Journey from First Cloud Program to AWS Partner (Hieu Nghi)
- **8-Step Career Roadmap:** Student Curiosity → First Cloud Journey → Workshop & Community → Hands-on Labs → School Projects → Portfolio → AWS Partner → Share Back.
- **Milestones & Programs:**
  - *First Cloud AI Journey Program:* Virtual LMS platform teaching core AWS services (budgets, IAM, VPC, EC2, storage, databases, monitoring).
